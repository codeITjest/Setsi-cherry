                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Fermata Musical Instruments started in September 2016 Headed by Mr. Mark James De Guzman.<br>
                    It is an online distributor for unique choices in musical Instruments,
                    Professional Audio, DJ Gear, <br>Lightning, and related accessories who aims to provide the
                    best possible musical products at a very affordable price.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By starting a buy and sell of guitars and accessories to distributors, it evolved into distributing
                    its own<br> guitar for the domestic market in 2020. After few years, it exported its first set of Guitar under its own.<br>
                    In order to meet the local demand for imported Guitars, Fermata acquired the distributorship of 
                    China-made<br>Smiger guitars and accessories.
